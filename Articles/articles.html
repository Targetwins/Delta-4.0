              The shakti refers to women. The Durga Mata (destroyer of evil) is one of the vital parts of every human being. Without her, the world is zero because, in terms of sacrifice, in terms of beliefs, in terms of power, in terms of care, in terms of understanding, and in terms of maternity, no one can over her, so since from birth to death, humans rely on her, so ultimately she is part of our lives, not only heart ❤️................
